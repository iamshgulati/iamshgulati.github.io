Hole punch cameras. A modern camera positioning strategy for OEMs for a way out of the more traditional over the bezel cameras or the rather polarizing “pop-up” cameras. They are great. They make the canvas available for expansion of pixels right up to the edge of the front and they look futuristic. But what’s not that great about those teeny tiny eyes on the front of your phone is their positioning.

Yes, I am talking about symmetry here.

In some cultures they say, _“Symmetry can conceal the complexity of the work at first glance”_. And it is perfectly meaningful. There isn’t a word more or a world less that I would add to this statement that would make it more meaningful that it already is.

As an exercise, just look around and count the number of things that are visible from where you sit. Now, how many of those are symmetrical by design?

Never mind, it’s a rhetorical question. I am sure you agree to my answer, “more than the number of those that are asymmetrical”.

Before we go too deep and lost in to the nitty-gritty of the beauty of all things symmetrical, let’s take a step back and address the elephant in the room. The position of hole punch cameras on smartphones.

Every presentation ever of any new smartphone begins with striking details about how the OEM worked hard to make the device look beautiful, make it light, and the elephant in the room I want to address to today, “make it balanced”.

Now, I know. I know. Before you say, Hey! But _balance_ does not equals to _symmetry_. Let me explain.

We have a perception of balance. And OEMs try to deliver on it one hundred percent by distributing the weight of all the parts that compose the smartphone by arranging them in the chassis of the phone in a way such that when a user holds the device in his hand, he perceives it to be well-balanced. And that is good for everyone.

But. What is not good for everyone is, OEMs sometimes forgetting that a lot of perception about how a device is also comes from how the device feels when being used for its primary purpose. Which in the case of smartphones is looking at that beautiful display all day every day, including the hole punch cameras. Because, why not. After all it is now sitting right inside that territory which we look at all the time.

And when you do look at it, it doesn't feel all that symmetric anymore. OEM has gone out of their way to push the punch hole camera to one corner so that it does not hinder the view when users are binge watching Netflix and YouTube on that gorgeous display.

But do you? Binge watch Netflix and YouTube on your smartphone any more than you do surfing, reading and socializing over the internet? I guessed so. Because that is exactly when the decision of placing the punch hole camera in to the corner starts to hurt your eye. You ask why? Because now, your perception changes. Now, you are looking at a tiny pitch black dot over a mostly white/light colored canvas and you can’t help but notice that the otherwise gorgeous view, is now not symmetric any more.

Content from one corner of the notification bar is pushed aside towards center too, and the whole things looks pretty messed up now!. What could have the OEM done to make it look less messed up? After all it was trying to help you in the best way possible to keep the black dot of of view in to a corner where your mind will slowly learn to accept its presence and eventually ignore its existence. But does it? eventually ignore its existence. I guess not.

So what again, could the OEM have done to add to the perception of a balanced device overall? At this point I am am pretty sure I don’t need to say it. Let the pictures speak for themselves.
