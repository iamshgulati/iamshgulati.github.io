import { Quote, Text } from "./components";

I love the idea behind [RadixUI Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes).

However, it does add a lot of unused css to the bundle.
I am trying to figure out the best way to axe as much unused css
from the bundle as possible but I have not been able to find an elegant
way to do it so far.

The only way I could reduce some of it was by cloning `@radix-ui/themes`
package into my monorepo and manually removing the unused css imports from it's
css export.

> Doing this cut down the overall css bundle by half. And [Pagespeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev) also stopped complaining about unused css.

I know, I know. I am not trying to justify my approach with the results.
It is bad in so many ways. Adds a bunch of maintenance debt which will
eventually be the reason I stop using the dependency in my next annual
website design refresh. But, I don't like to obsess too much on just reaching the end goal.

```jsx eval
<Text as="p" size="4" mt="6" mb="6">
  <Quote>The process of how you reach there is just as important.</Quote>
</Text>
```

So, I am still exploring ways to get this done _more elegantly_ without having
to clone a bunch of code within my monorepo. If you have any ideas, do [reach out](/contact) to discuss. Any help is appreciated.

Thanks.

Update â€” three days later.

- Removed the cloned package.
- Applied my changes to the dependency using `pnpm patch`.

<br />

Since the changes I needed in the css were inside `src` directory, I couldn't directly patch target css files. The exported css in dependency is compiled on build step. So, I had to build the package with my changes applied, and copy the output css from `dist` directory and apply the patch using `pnpm patch`.

Still not ideal, but something that works and is better than not having it.
