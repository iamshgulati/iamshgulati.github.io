## Summary

As an award-winning Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience at top U.S. and Canadian consulting firms, I bring deep knowledge of software development to the table. I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering, certifications in AWS, and specializations in Cloud Computing, and Application Security. I excel at building scalable enterprise solutions using Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices. I also have keen interest and hands-on experience in cloud ecosystems and simple web application frontends.

I began my career as an Associate Software Engineer at CGI Inc. in Bangalore, India. At CGI, I honed my skills in service-oriented architecture, web development, and unit testing, using Java and Spring. I was awarded for creating an innovative state management solution that reduced the maintenance downtime during production upgrade cycles by 95%.

My career journey continued at Deloitte Consulting US-India in Bangalore, India. I started as a Business Technology Analyst and was soon promoted to Consultant, and later to Senior Consultant. While at Deloitte, I further enriched my skills with cloud-native technologies like Spring Boot, Microservices, and the cloud ecosystem. I was awarded multiple times throughout my stint for my dedication to problem-solving, exploring new technologies, developing innovative solutions, and delivering critical parts of large-scale enterprise applications.

Beyond my professional experience, I am an avid learner, always upgrading my skills to stay relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry. My certifications in AWS and specializations in Cloud Computing and Application Security are a testament to this. I am always seeking opportunities to learn new technologies outside my domain.

I am actively looking for software development roles, where I can leverage my technical skills and experience to deliver delightful experiences for users and businesses. If you are looking for a tech professional with a knack for development and an unwavering commitment to excellence, I would love to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team.

## Skills & Tools

I started my career as a software engineer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stacks, both back-end, and front-end.

Even though the scope of software and web development is broad, I was primarily focused on **back-end development**.
However, recently I have also started learning more about front-end technologies and designing clean, minimalistic, and modern UI interfaces.

### Back-End Development

I love creating back-ends that are on the bleeding edge of technology, that work reliably, and are highly scalable.

I have enjoyed using **microservices** to create enterprise web applications, including:

- Customer Support Portal
- User Dashboard
- Ecommerce Order Fulfillment Services
- Human Resources Portal
- Usage Reporting Services
- M2M IoT Platform

and others.

### Front-End Development

I am also enjoying making simple web pages like the ones on this website. So, what tools did I use for creating this website?

- React
- Next.js
- RadixUI
- TypeScript
