Emoverse is your trusted partner to let out your thoughts, record your moods and emotional states. Let's begin feeling healthier together.

This project is an experiment to see how a modern app, with features like authentication, database, and API routes can be hosted using fully-managed serverless cloud services.

Frontend and Backend is built using full-stack technologies such as Next.js, Typescript, React.js, and TailwindCSS.

In the future I will work hard to add more features to enhance the user experience and usability of Emoverse.
