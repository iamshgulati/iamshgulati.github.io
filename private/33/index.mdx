Year 2023 started with chaos. I was stepping into some wild and unknown lands, and sure as hell I was scared as shit. Scared of the unknown. Scared of — will I be able to justify the bold moves I was making. There were so many questions, and not enough answers. I was running dry. For many days, I did want to quit and go back to the same comfortable place in life. Was it good? No. But was it comfortable? Sure... Don't we all love comfort? How many times does it happen when we know something or someone or someplace is not good for us and yet we continue to suck it up because it is _comfortable_.

But, sometimes, the very thing that we find so comforting lands us into trouble. I would even argue, sticking to the most comfortable thing lands us into trouble more often than just sometimes. So then the question that arises is — what must we do? What must we do to protect ourselves from such trouble? The simple answer is — take bold steps more often. Now let me elaborate.

Most people will not be fearless when they take a step into the unknown. But what helps is to take steps despite the fear. If someone or something was to tell you the kind of things that you will experience into unknown land, one of these two things will happen — A. you backoff immediately because you don't want to put yourself through the pain of change; or B. you find out the amazing things that are going to happen for and you jump into the opportunity but end up slacking in your efforts because we were so sure that great things are right around the corner and you never really end up anywhere near those things because you did not work hard enough to guarantee a win.

I was in a similar situation right before 2023 had started. I was headed into the dark and I had no clue what was in it for me a week later. Absolute dark. And honestly, if I knew, I would never have taken those steps. But an year later, do I regret taking those steps into the dark? Absolutely not. Was it easy? Heck no. But was it worth it? Damn right it was. Year 2023 has been and will possibly remain one of the most transformational years in the journey of my life. And what did it take for me to be able to live this day? — sharing my story here and saying this with head held up high that I am glad I stepped out of the comfortable life and headed straight into the unknown lands.

It took courage. Courage is not a lack of fear. Rather, it is very much the presence of fear. Courage is when you do whatever it is you wanted to do despite being afraid of what lies ahead. When you show courage, life rewards you enormously. The rewards might not be easy to recognize in the beginning, but once you see past the initial few days (or months or years depending on the scale of your goal) of discomfort you will certainly realize that you have outgrown the setbacks and you are a better person than what you used to be. Once you see your pains transforming into gains, you will fall in love with the process and that is what will make amazing things happen for you.

I have so many more things to say, but not all things that I want to say needs to be said. At least not yet. For few things, you just —

    Let them touch you, let them teach you, and then let them never be said ever again.

```

Peace.
