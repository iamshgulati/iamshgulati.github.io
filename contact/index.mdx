In the past I have shared my email address in public, but it was misused by spammers to send me junk mails.
So, I refrain from sharing my email address in the public anymore.

But you can still get in touch with me through any of my social media profiles.

## Social Media

If you want to find me on social media, just search for `iamshgulati`. That's my username on almost all platforms.

For your convenience, I have also included my social media links below.

| Social       | Link                                                      |
